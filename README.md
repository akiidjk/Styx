Styx - Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

Styx is a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) project designed to provide advanced protection at both the host and application levels. This design is built using modern technologies such as eBPF and XDP, with the goal of providing high performance, flexibility, and a modular architecture.

Origin of the Name

The name “Styx” is inspired by the famous river in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, which separates the world of the living from Hell. Styx represents an impassable barrier, a symbolic boundary that no one can cross without permission. Similarly, this firewall stands as an impenetrable defense, protecting the network from unwanted threats and traffic.
